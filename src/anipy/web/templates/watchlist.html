  "description": "After the success of his crowdfunded movie featuring the woman of his dreams, Chizuru Ichinose, university student Kazuya Kinoshita resumes his life of lies and deception. Although he pretends that he has been in an ideal relationship with Chizuru for more than a year, Kazuya still mostly sees her through a rental girlfriend company's services.    However, after Kazuya attends a private party with Chizuru, he reaches the decision to finally confess his feelings to her. Unfortunately for him, his trial girlfriend Ruka Sarashina and his ex-girlfriend Mami Nanami continue to complicate his already messy attempts at romance. While he is forced to keep up his facade, Kazuya is under pressure to find a solution to his ever chaotic love life.",
